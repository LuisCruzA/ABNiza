Functions: camelCase or PascalCase

Code Organization
Proper spacing between declarations, functions, and classes

Organized import/export structure

🔀 Gitflow Workflow
Main Branches
main: Production-ready code

develop: Integration branch for features

Workflow
Each team member creates a feature branch from develop

Work is done on that feature branch using our naming convention

Once completed, it's merged back into develop

Hotfixes
If a bug is found in production, a hotfix branch is created from main

After the fix, it's merged into both main and develop

This workflow ensures a stable production environment with ongoing development flexibility.

✅ Commit Rules
We follow the Conventional Commits standard:

bash
Copiar
Editar
<type>: <description>
